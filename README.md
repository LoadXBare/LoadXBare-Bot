# LoadXBot
## About
**LoadXBot** (formerly LoadXBare Bot) is a Discord bot programmed in the Python programming language. It originally started out as a small gimmick project I was developing for a Discord server in order to better practise using Python and Discord.py however interest was expressed in having the bot go public and so is now being actively developed as a side hobby, whenever a bug is found and/or a new feature comes to mind, I'm right on programming it!

If for whatever reason you wish to use any code found here then feel free to copy whatever you like!
Additionally, feel free to fork this repo, make changes and then create a pull request as I'm open to contributions.

## Requirements
Thinking of forking the project and making your own changes? In that case here is a heads up that LoadXBot requires the following libraries:\
• discord.py\
• psycopg2-binary\
• python-dotenv
