# LoadXBare Bot
## About
**LoadXBare Bot** is a Discord bot programmed in the Python programming language. It originally started out as a small gimmick project I was developing for a Discord server in order to better practise using Python and Discord.py however interest was expressed in having the bot go public and so is now being actively developed as a side hobby, whenever a bug is found and/or a new feature comes to mind, I'm right on programming it!
