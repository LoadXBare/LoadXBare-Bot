# LoadXBare Bot
## About
**LoadXBare Bot** is a Discord bot programmed in the Python programming language. I'm developing this simply as a gimmick for a Discord server as well as to better practice using Python and Discord.py, so don't expect this code to be efficient or good by any means.

If for whatever reason you wish to use any code found here then feel free to copy whatever you like!

## To-Do
