# LoadXBare Bot
## About
**LoadXBare Bot** is a Discord bot programmed in the Python programming language. It originally started out as a small gimmick project I was developing for a Discord server in order to better practise using Python and Discord.py however interest was expressed in having the bot go public and so is now split into 2 versions:

**Version #1** - Includes commands specific to the "Pumpki Patch" Discord server\
**Version #2** - Public build without any commands targeted towards specific servers / users
